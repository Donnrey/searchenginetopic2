      <h1><b>What is Search Engine Optimization?</b>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Search Engine Optimization is the process of generating a website and maximizing the number of visitors and making sure that your site has the most relevant needs to what your clients are looking for.</p>

      <h1><b>Guidlines on how to read a Search Engine Result Page</b>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">CHECK OUT THE BIG TWO: ORGANIC AND PAY PER CLICK. Search results are mostly dominated by two particular indexes: the organic or natural search results, and the PPC (Pay Per Click) search results. The organic-results index is created by searchbots. For instance, Google uses something called a googlebot to retrieve pages. It’s common to talk about searchbots as if somehow they wander around the Web, moving from page to page through links between the pages, collecting the pages, and sending them back to home base to be analyzed and indexed. The search results typically put ten results from the organic index into the search-results page, though, those results are often interspersed with other types of search results. (In some cases, in particular when adding local results to the page, the search engines may display a smaller number of organic-search results, perhaps seven or eight.) Today, the three major search engines all display PPC ads, ads that cost the advertiser nothing until someone clicks the ad, at which point the advertiser is charged instantly. PPC ads are typically placed at the top of the search results (three or four results, though sometimes Google omits the top ads) and in a column to the right of the main search results.</p>

      <h1><b>List some Important SEO Expectations</b> </h1>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">*Knowing only a few pages or posts on your site might ever rank well.

The importance of backlinks can’t be stressed enough. Focus as much of your time as possible on the promotion of your content. It’s common for a large proportion of your overall organic search traffic to come from a very small proportion of your overall content. Without doubt, the biggest cause of failure with SEO campaigns is the assumption that simply creating great content will get you results.

*Failing to adjust.
Once upon a time, your first shot at SEO may have yielded solid results. Now, making a serious and strategic attempt at SEO is the starting point. I see this situation frequently, for example: if you’re not ranking for that perfect keyword yet, go after a new one. Don’t lose sight of those great keywords, but don’t sit around thinking your site will magically start ranking for it if it hasn’t yet. You have to pursue, in the meanwhile, related additional longer-tail, less competitive phrases, which help you gain ground in tackling higher trafficked terms.

*SEO is more than just plugging holes.
This is not as easy as plugging holes. It is more than that.SEO just takes more things coming together. You have to identify, and work the opportunities, as much as you have to plug holes.

*The magic is in the maintenance.
It is rarely the one-time work that will meet your goals and expectations. When you lay the SEO foundation on your website—selecting keywords, undergoing the rigorous, yet important minutiae of on-page optimization, redirecting and site speed and other technical obstacles—that used to be all it took. Today, it is the starting point.

*Reality checking your budget.
do you have the time and money to invest? It will require a mix of both. And when I say “both” I mean “both.” You cannot get results by throwing money at the problem. SEO, especially initially, requires an investment of dollars and a mix of people of strategists, tactical doers, and purse-string holders.</p>

1. Optimization via software – Many SEO companies utilize software programs which attempt to trick search engines or manipulate them into giving your site better placement than is really deserved. If an SEO company uses words like shadow pages, cloaking, doorway pages, link farms, proprietary software, etc. when talking to you, then they are not a reputable company. These techniques can get your site banned from the search engines altogether, and if you ever decided to leave one of these companies, then your rankings stay with them.You do not want their software, YOU WANT YOUR SITE OPTIMIZED!<br><br>

4. Content, Content, Content – If you meet with an SEO company that does not emphasize a lot of relevant, optimized content, then look somewhere else.<br><br>

5. Low Hanging Fruit – Many optimization companies simply optimize your site for keywords that are rarely searched, or worse yet, not searched at all. This practice is referred to as low hanging fruit. Not all instances of low hanging fruit are bad, but you want your site to be optimized for the more highly searched terms as well.
