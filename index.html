      <h1><b>What is Search Engine Optimization?</b>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Search Engine Optimization is the process of generating a website and maximizing the number of visitors and making sure that your site has the most relevant needs to what your clients are looking for.</p>

      <h1><b>Guidlines on how to read a Search Engine Result Page</b>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">CHECK OUT THE BIG TWO: ORGANIC AND PAY PER CLICK. Search results are mostly dominated by two particular indexes: the organic or natural search results, and the PPC (Pay Per Click) search results. The organic-results index is created by searchbots. For instance, Google uses something called a googlebot to retrieve pages. It’s common to talk about searchbots as if somehow they wander around the Web, moving from page to page through links between the pages, collecting the pages, and sending them back to home base to be analyzed and indexed. The search results typically put ten results from the organic index into the search-results page, though, those results are often interspersed with other types of search results. (In some cases, in particular when adding local results to the page, the search engines may display a smaller number of organic-search results, perhaps seven or eight.) Today, the three major search engines all display PPC ads, ads that cost the advertiser nothing until someone clicks the ad, at which point the advertiser is charged instantly. PPC ads are typically placed at the top of the search results (three or four results, though sometimes Google omits the top ads) and in a column to the right of the main search results.</p>

      <h1><b>List some Important SEO Expectations</b> </h1>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Knowing other websites might include similar information as well", you must ensure that you meet the needs of your clients. For instance, if your website is about a particular topic, it should have enough information and all you can offer written down.
Using "keywords" would also help direct visitors to your website and boost your site on the list of results on the search engine. e.g, using common and/or mostly used words. You should also "focus as much of your time as possible on the promotion of your contents"</p>
  <h1><b>Components of a sucessful website</b></h1>
      <p>
        When first setting up your site you need to pick a theme or topic to focus on and it's important NOT to deviate from this choice! Now when creating content for your platform you'll want to post updates that reflect some type of relevancy to your chosen theme! This is very important because people who land on your site are looking for information pertaining to the topic your platform is based upon! If what you post is what they are looking for this increases the chance these people will become return visitors! On the other hand if you do deviate from your selected topic your readers may become confused and therefore disinterested leaving your blog to never return again! This is NOT how to develop reader loyalty and build a following!<br><br>

Entertaining your readers as a blogger can be as simple as allowing your personality to 'shine' through when posting updates! For starters this helps make what you write more unique simply because there is nobody that has the same exact personality as yours! People may be entertained by the quirkiness of your insights or the satirical way you deliver information! In any case JUST BE YOU since it's a more natural role for you to play and therefore will make creating content all the more easier for you!<br><br>

Let's face it there is only so much 'breaking news' you can relay to your readers that's relevant to their interests! On the other hand by offering your 'perspective and insights' on an existing topic you can still intrigue and thus engage your readers! Content that offers people a different look at a familiar subject helps them expand their thinking and possibly bring a better focus to new opportunities!<br><br>


Be it late breaking news or perhaps something that teaches or instructs, you always want to try creating content that is useful! Now every update you post does not need to be 'useful' but you do want to be sure your readers are getting value out of what you offer! By dusting off something old and presenting it in a new way is much like showing someone another use for an existing tool!<br><br>

Always remember to allow comments when blogging since people enjoy offering their input and/or suggestions! Additionally people can exchange their own thoughts and ideas with other readers through comments which helps 'further' the sense of community! You want those who land on your site to feel welcomed and comfortable to further compel them to return! Projecting a sense of belonging or community encourages visitors become return visitors!<br><br>
